				<header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
				<h3>Information for first-timers:</h3>
				<ul>
						<li>First of all - Welcome!</li>
						<li><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gwo/coworking_collaboration_to_combat_akrasia/">This</a> post that was the initial start towards this type of co-working to beat akrasia, resulting in this chat room.</li>
						<li>We work in “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoros</a>”</li>
						<li>There are no strict rules to follow. Generally upon entering you can either introduce yourself and a little about what you will (or would want to) work with or you can ask others what they are working with. Rather do this on the breaks.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I would like to remind you all that this place is what we make it to be. I think we should be friendly and especially encouraging to new users who may need that extra push to get on the right track.</p>
				<p>High-held values in the chat room should be those that correlate with akrasia-management – you are freely allowed to brag about how many pomodoros you did and what you accomplished by working. Those who do well and are satisfied with their work should be respected and given credit for their performance.</p>
				<p>The chat room should constantly improve. It should be improving in the “fun-ness” and precommitment that encourage returning to it and akrasia-management to ensure maximal gain while being there.</p>
